# Closet Collection

## About
The **Closet Collection** application gives the user a picture/information overview of the current state of their wardrobe. The user is able to *add, edit, and remove pieces of clothing* in their collection, as well as *create tags for specific attributes*. Using this overview, the user is able to *create and save outfits*, and have *insight on the details* of their clothing collection.

This application is created for *personal use*, and for those who have an interest in fashion. Specifically, an interest in *promoting sustainability* by reusing pieces already owned. By having an overview of all the pieces in your wardrobe, it is much easier to assemble outfits that might not be obvious when pieces are stored away in a closet. Being able to filter pieces through tags, lets people see how much of a specific thing they own, and can be categorized in a certain way to match similar styles.
